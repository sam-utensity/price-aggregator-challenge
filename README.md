# Considerations

## Improvements

Integration tests for thorough test coverage

## Websocket

Add authentication for certain connection types (listen for user trades etc)


### Folder Structure

Chosen to do away with classic spring folder convention "controller", "service", "repository" etc.
Instead, going with a business driven/ domain structure


TODO:

4) Build scripts and instructions
5) Code clean up and prettying
6) Finish any additional instructions and README
7) STRETCH - Branch with stubs for Coinbase etc
